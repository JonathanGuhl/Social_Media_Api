# Social_Media_Api

## Description 

- Here I have set up API routes for a social media company using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en). This is backend work only.

- This will allow you to make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` request to a restful API.

## Installation

- Make sure you have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed or you will not be able to run this application.

- Assuming you have done that, you'll clone this repository.

- After you've done that, `cd` into the correct directory and run `npm install` and then run `npm run seeds`.

- After that you'll run `npm start` to get the server up and running. 

## Usage 

- With the server running you'll open up your restfulAPI and make the proper requests. I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest)

- You can follow this video below on how to you would go about doing that.
